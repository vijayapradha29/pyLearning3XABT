#Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.

#=operator->it is used to assign values to variables
pi=3.14#float
age=35#integer
name="vijaya"#string
boolean=True#boolean
#All these are examples of "=operator"

##-are used to compare values of two variables
#if both values are same then it returns True value else it retuens False value
#it always returns a boolean value
a=10
b=10
print(a==b)#it returns boolean value as True



#2.What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?
# **->it is the power operator in python
# it takes the power of the first number and displays the value as result
print(2**3)#it returns 8
#means it displays the value 8 as 2 to the power of 3

#3.What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?
a=10#binary value-1010
b=20#binary value-10100
print(a^b)
#it returns 30,binary value-11110
# ^->it is the XOR operator in python,used in bitwise operations.
